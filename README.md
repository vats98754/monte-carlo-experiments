# Monte Carlo Simulations via Hierarchical Models

Doing some experiments using Monte Carlo simulations on RStudio - I want to dive deeper into hierarchical models using simulation methods, of which Monte Carlo seems the most widely applicable.

My goal is to connect different datasets in attempts to chain latent parameters to obtain some sort of joint probability distributions between two or more groups of data.

This is mostly a way to learn how to implement different Monte Carlo simulations varying by the complexity in my hypotheses.
